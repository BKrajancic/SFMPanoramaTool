# SFM Panorama Toolkit

This is the source filmmaker panorama toolkit! This program will help out users of SFM to make their very own panoramic videos!

Dependencies:

##Program Features:

###Batch Rename Tools.
Instead of exporting each image sequence one at a time from SFM, export them sequentially into one big chunk. Then you can use the batch rename tool to organise each seperate angle into its own folder! For example:

Input:
Video_01
Video_02
video_03
video_04

Output:
angle1/video_01
angle1/video_02
angle2/video_01
angle2/video_02

###Batch Avi Creation. -Completed

Similar to the batch rename tools, but it will instead export the images into a single .AVI file each, useful for importing into blender

###SFM Panorama Setter -Completed
This tool can import a .DMX file of a single shot and camera, then it can turn this into several shots each with different angles, AND the right FOV settings, ready for export. 

###Blender Preset
This tool is more than likely not going to be made (as its stupidly easy to do this part) however this tool would allow you to turn existing image sequences into a blender file ready for export!


This tool may even allow users to begin rendering (with blender) immedietly after rendering, but no promises on that one.
