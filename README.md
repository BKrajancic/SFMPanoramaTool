# Unofficial SFM Panorama Toolkit

This is the unofficial source filmmaker panorama toolkit! This program will help out users of SFM to make their very own panoramic videos!

#Dependencies and libraries
This program adapts Logan McCloud's 360 degree method. Check out his stuff at: http://hyperchaotixanimation.tumblr.com/

This software uses libraries from the FFmpeg project under the LGPL v2.1. 
FFmpeg is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard, originator of the FFmpeg project.

##Program Features: 

###Batch Rename Tools.
Instead of exporting each image sequence one at a time from SFM, export them sequentially into one big chunk. Then you can use the batch rename tool to organise each seperate angle into its own folder! For example:

Input:
Video_01
Video_02
video_03
video_04

Output:
angle1/video_01
angle1/video_02
angle2/video_01
angle2/video_02

###Batch Avi Creation.

Similar to the batch rename tools, but it will instead export the images into a single 1:1 .AVI file each, useful for importing into blender

###SFM Panorama Setter
This tool can import a .DMX file of a single shot and camera, then it can turn this into several shots each with different angles, AND the right FOV settings, ready for export.

###TODO: 
User Experience Changes
Remove dependency on Accord.Video.FFMpeg with another library
Allow to be run from the command line, and thus Source Film Maker
